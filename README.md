Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client in this scenario is The Gaming Room, and they have requested assistance from Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) in developing a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is based on the concept of the television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams guess phrases or titles based on images rendered from a stock drawing library.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing the documentation, one particular strength was ensuring that the game and team names must be unique to avoid conflicts and allow users to check name availability when choosing team names. This demonstrates attention to detail and consideration for potential naming conflicts.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

During the process of working through the design document, it was helpful to have a clear understanding of the game's requirements, such as the four rounds of play, the rendering of images, and the time limits. This helped in structuring the code and making decisions on how to implement these features effectively.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of the work, I would focus on providing more detailed information on the unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player. This would ensure clarity on how the uniqueness would be maintained and managed in the code.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

To interpret the user's needs and implement them into the software design, I would consider factors such as the requirement for multiple teams with multiple players, the need for unique game and team names, and the limitation of having only one instance of the game in memory. This would involve careful consideration of data structures, logic, and functionality to meet these requirements effectively and provide an optimal user experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

In approaching the design of the software, I would adopt techniques such as object-oriented programming, database modeling for managing game, team, and player information, and incorporating validation and error handling to ensure data integrity. Additionally, regular communication and collaboration with the client and team members would be key to understand and address any evolving requirements or challenges during the development process.
